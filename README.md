# Classified Data for Unsupervised Learning using K-Nearest Neighbors

In this project, we assume that we are given a classified data set and we will use K-Nearest Neighbors method of unsupervised learning to createand train a model. The best k-value that would give lowest error will be identified and the model will be evaluated based on the k-value found.

Here, we will see more information on the dataset and a pairplot of the target column and the columns.
