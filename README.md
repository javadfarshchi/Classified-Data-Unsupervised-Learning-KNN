# Classified Data for Supervised Learning using K-Nearest Neighbors

In this project, we assume that we are given a classified data set and we will use K-Nearest Neighbors method of unsupervised learning to createand train a model. The best k-value that would give lowest error will be identified and the model will be evaluated based on the k-value found. Complete notebook with the code can be found [here](https://github.com/javadfarshchi/Classified-Data-Unsupervised-Learning-KNN/blob/main/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Project%20-%20Unsupervised%20Learning.ipynb).

Here, we will see more information on the dataset and a pairplot of the target column and the columns.
